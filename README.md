# Hi, I'm TalÃ­a!

Iâ€™m passionate about wellness and excited to apply my tech skills in roles that leverage technology to develop products that genuinely improve people's well-being and quality of life.

I enjoy being active, I recently moved to Florida from New York so Iâ€™m enjoying spending more time in nature. Recently been getting into neuroscience (God really gave us amazing brains!), calisthenics, and herbal medicine.
