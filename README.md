### Hi I'm Talia! ðŸ˜„

As a rising fsw developer, I'm enjoying a new path to self-expression at Pursuit, an intensive 12 - month software engineering fellowship with a 9% acceptance rate. 

I love the process of creating clean code and discovering different ways to get the same result. I have learned through pair programming that the beauty of coding lies in the spaces it creates for collaboration. We all think differently, and software development encourages these differences and makes them work together to create amazing outcomes. 

When I'm not coding you can find me spending time with family and friends, dancing to EVERYTHING, and bike riding.
