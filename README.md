### Hi I'm Talía!🙋🏻‍♀️

As a rising fsw developer, I'm enjoying a new journey to self-expression at Pursuit, an intensive 12 - month software engineering fellowship with a 9% acceptance rate. 

I 💜 the process of creating clean code and discovering different ways to get the same result. I have learned through pair programming that the beauty of coding lies in the spaces it creates for collaboration. We all think differently 🌎, and software development encourages these differences and makes them work together to create amazing outcomes ✨. 

When I'm not coding 👩🏻‍💻 you can find me spending time with family and friends, dancing to EVERYTHING 💃🏻, and bike riding 🚴🏻‍♀️.
