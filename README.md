### Hi I'm Talía! 🙋🏻‍♀️

A full stack web developer from Dominican Republic 🇩🇴.

I 💜 the process of creating clean code and discovering different ways to get the same result. I have learned through pair programming that the beauty of coding lies in the spaces it creates for collaboration. We all think differently 🌎, and software development encourages these differences and makes them work together to create amazing outcomes ✨. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on rebuilding my personal website with React
- 🌱 I’m currently learning PostgreSQL.
