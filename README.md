# Hi, I'm Tal√≠a!

I love tech and I love connecting with people. I recently moved to Florida from New York City, so I'm excited to bring my skills to roles that connect people with technology in meaningful ways. I believe the best solutions are built through collaboration and community, and that learning should always be engaging, fun and exciting!

With experience in education, programming, and technical support, I bring a passion for tech and learning to every role I take on, making each project a chance to create something impactful and enjoyable for everyone involved.

Outside of work you can find me with family soaking up the outdoors üåä‚õ∞Ô∏è or working on a health & fitness app (stay tuned!)
