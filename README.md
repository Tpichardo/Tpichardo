# Hi, I'm TalÃ­a!

Iâ€™m passionate about wellness and excited to apply my tech skills in roles that leverage technology to develop products that genuinely improve people's well-being and quality of life.

I enjoy being active, and after recently moving to Florida from New York City, Iâ€™m enjoying spending more time in nature. Lately, I've been diving into neuroscience, calisthenics, and herbal medicine just for fun.
